    "One view of knowledge is that the mind maintains working models of parts of the world. ‘Model’ in the sense that it captures some of the structure in the world, but not all (and what it captures need not be exactly what is in the world—just what is useful). ‘Working’ in the sense that it can be used to simulate this part of the world, imagining what will follow from different initial conditions. As an example take the Plinko machine: a box with uniformly spaced pegs, with bins at the bottom. Into this box we can drop marbles.\n",
    "The plinko machine is a ‘working model’ for many physical processes in which many small perturbations accumulate—for instance a leaf falling from a tree. It is an approximation to these systems because we use a discrete grid (the pegs) and discrete bins. Yet it is useful as a model: for instance, we can ask where we expect a marble to end up depending on where we drop it in, by running the machine several times—simulating the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that someone has dropped a marble into the plinko machine; before looking at the outcome, you can probably report how much you believe that the ball has landed in each possible bin. Indeed, if you run the plinko machine many times, you will see a shape emerge in the bins. The number of balls in a bin gives you some idea how much you should expect a new marble to end up there. This ‘shape of expected outcomes’ can be formalized as a probability distribution (described below). Indeed, there is an intimate connection between simulation, expectation or belief, and probability, which we explore in the rest of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more thing to note about our Plinko machine above: we are using a computer program to simulate the simulation. Computers can be seen as universal simulators. How can we, clearly and precisely, describe the simulation we want a computer to do?\n"

    "We wish to describe in formal terms how to generate states of the world. That is, we wish to describe the causal process, or steps that unfold, leading to some potentially observable states.

    "Programming languages are formal systems for describing what (deterministic) computation a computer should do. Modern programming languages offer a wide variety of different ways to describe computation; each makes some processes simple to describe and others more complex. However, a key tenet of computer science is that all of these languages have the same fundamental power: any computation that can be described with one programming language can be described by another. (More technically this Church-Turing thesis posits that many specific computational systems capture the set of all effectively computable procedures. These are called universal systems.)\r\n",

That is, the probability of making choice `B` given that choice `A` has been made in a certain way. Only when the second choice does not depend on (or \"look at\") the first choice does this expression reduce to a simple product of the probabilities of each choice individually: $P(A,B)=P(A)P(B)$.\r\n",

    "We cannot simply use the product rule to determine this probability because we don't know the sequence of random choices that led to this return value. However we can notice that the program will return true if the two component choices are `[true, true]`, or `[true, false]`, or `[false, true]`. To combine these possibilities we use another rule for probabilities: If there are two alternative sequences of choices that lead to the same return value, the probability of this return value is the sum of the probabilities of the sequences. We can write this using probability notation as: *$P(A)$ = $\\sum_{\\substack{B}} P(A, B)$*, where we view A as the final value and B as a random choice on the way to that value. Using the product rule we can determine that the probability in the example above is 0.25 for each sequence that leads to return value `true`, then, by the sum rule, the probability of `true` is 0.25+0.25+0.25=0.75.\r\n",
    "Using the sum rule to compute the probability of a final value is called is sometimes called *marginalization*, because the final distribution is the marginal distribution on final values. From the point of view of sampling processes marginalization is simply ignoring (or not looking at) intermediate random values that are created on the way to a final return value. From the point of view of directly computing probabilities, marginalization is summing over all the possible \"histories\" that could lead to a return value. Putting the product and sum rules together, the marginal probability of return values from a program that we have explored above is the sum over sampling histories of the product over choice probabilities—a computation that can quickly grow unmanageable, but can be approximated by sampling."

We can do this using a Julia package: `Memoize`. `@memoize` is a macro that can be applied to a procedure and produces a memoized version of the procedure. When a stochastic procedure is memoized, it will sample a random value the first time it is used with some arguments, but return that same value when called with those arguments thereafter. The resulting memoized procedure has a persistent value within each \"run\" of the generative model (or simulated world).

    "This type of modeling is called *random world* style (McAllester et al., 2008). Note that we don't have to specify ahead of time the people whose eye color we will ask about: the distribution on eye colors is implicitly defined over the infinite set of possible people, but only constructed \"lazily\" when needed. Memoizing stochastic functions thus provides a powerful toolkit to represent and reason about an unbounded set of properties of an unbounded set of objects. For instance, here we define a function `flipAlot` that maps from an integer (or any other value) to a coin flip. We could use it to implicitly represent the *n*th flip of a particular coin, without having to actually flip the coin *n* times."
